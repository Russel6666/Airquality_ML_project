# Airquality_ML_project
# Project Motivation
# Air quality is a very heated topic for any time. The development of technology is a double-edged sword to the environment. In this project, I try to explore the possibility of predicting carbon monoxide (CO) levels using data from low-cost chemical sensors and environmental readings, offering a scalable solution for real-time, dense air quality estimation.
